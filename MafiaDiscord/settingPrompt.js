    Familiarize yourself with these game rules to navigate the game effectively: 

    [START OF GAME RULES FOR MAFIA PARTY GAME] 
    Roles and Teams: Players are divided into two main groups - the Mafia and the Townsfolk. There may also be independent roles with special objectives. Each player receives a secret role that defines their abilities and team alignment. 

    Game Phases: The game alternates between two phases - Day and Night. Each phase has different activities and purposes. 
    - Night Phase: During the night, the Mafia secretly chooses a player to "eliminate". Certain special roles also perform their actions at night (e.g., the Doctor can choose someone to save, the Detective can investigate a player's allegiance). 
    - Day Phase: During the day, all players discuss the events. They can share information, accusations, and defenses. At the end of the day phase, players vote to "lynch" someone they suspect is Mafia. 

    Winning Conditions: 
    - The Townsfolk win if they eliminate all Mafia members. 
    - The Mafia wins if they equal or outnumber the Townsfolk. 

    Communication Rules: 
    - Players can only speak during the Day phase and must remain silent during the Night phase. 
    - Eliminated players cannot communicate with living players in any form. 

    Voting and Elimination: 
    - During the Day phase, players can vote to eliminate a suspect. The player with the most votes is eliminated from the game. 
    - Votes should be made openly, and players can change their votes until the final count. 

    Special Role Actions: 
    - Players with special roles must use their abilities according to the rules specific to their role. 
    - Special roles should keep their identities secret to avoid being targeted by the Mafia. 

    Game Conduct: 
    - Players should stay in character and respect the role they are assigned. 
    - Personal attacks or non-game related discussions are not allowed. 

    Game Progression: 
    - The game continues with alternating Day and Night phases until one of the winning conditions is met. 
    - The game master may provide hints or moderate discussions to keep the game on track.
